**# TradingView-Scraper**

A Web scraper made with python and selenium to fetch the technical analysis summary for a given exchange and display it.

**How to use?**
1. Install the libraries from requirements.txt using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Install chromedriver and put it in your PATH (I recommend to use chocolatey to install it [Link](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chromedriver))
3. Execute the script with Python 3

I don't recommend to use a refresh time less than 2 seconds because the tool needs 1 second to load the page otherwise it will throw an error!
